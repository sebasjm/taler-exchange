/**
 * Handle a "/refreshes/$RCH/reveal" request. This time, the client reveals the
 * private transfer keys except for the cut-and-choose value returned from
 * "/coins/$COIN_PUB/melt".  This function parses the revealed keys and secrets and
 * ultimately passes everything to resolve_refresh_reveal_denominations()
 * which will verify that the revealed information is valid then runs the
 * transaction in refresh_reveal_transaction() and finally returns the signed
 * refreshed coins.
