# This will generate testcases in a directory 'afl-tests', which can then
# be moved into src/exchange/afl-tests/ to be run during exchange-testing.
#
# This script uses American Fuzzy Loop (AFL) to fuzz the exchange to
# automatically create tests with good coverage.  You must install
# AFL and set AFL_HOME to the directory where AFL is installed
# before running.  Also, a directory "baseline/" should exist with
# templates for inputs for AFL to fuzz.  These can be generated
# by running wireshark on loopback while running 'make check' in
# this directory.  Save each HTTP request to a new file.
#
# Note that you want to switch 'TESTRUN = NO' and pre-init the
# database before running this, otherwise it will be awfully slow.
#
# Must be run from this directory.
