-- This script restart the auditor state as done to RESTART
-- an audit from scratch. It does NOT drop tables and also
-- PRESERVES data that running the auditor would not recover,
-- such as:
-- * the list of audited exchanges
-- * deposit confirmation reports the auditor received from merchants
-- * schema versioning information
-- * signing keys of exchanges we have downloaded
--
-- Unlike the other SQL files, it SHOULD be updated to reflect the
-- latest requirements for dropping tables.
