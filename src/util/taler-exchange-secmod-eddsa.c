/**
 * @file util/taler-exchange-secmod-eddsa.c
 * @brief Standalone process to perform private key EDDSA operations
 * @author Christian Grothoff
 *
 * Key design points:
 * - EVERY thread of the exchange will have its own pair of connections to the
 *   crypto helpers.  This way, every threat will also have its own /keys state
 *   and avoid the need to synchronize on those.
 * - auditor signatures and master signatures are to be kept in the exchange DB,
 *   and merged with the public keys of the helper by the exchange HTTPD!
 * - the main loop of the helper is SINGLE-THREADED, but there are
 *   threads for crypto-workers which (only) do the signing in parallel,
 *   working of a work-queue.
 * - thread-safety: signing happens in parallel, thus when REMOVING private keys,
 *   we must ensure that all signers are done before we fully free() the
 *   private key. This is done by reference counting (as work is always
 *   assigned and collected by the main thread).
